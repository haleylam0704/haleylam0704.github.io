## hi!
***

I'm currently in my final year of undergrad, studying psychology and economics at Baylor University. 

My research interests:
- **AI Companionship**: Can AI companions sufficiently replace human relationships? Should it happen?
- **AI in Therapy**: Can AI replace therapists and make psychotherapy more accessible? What are its potential risks and benefits?
- **Psychopathy & Antisocial Behavior**: What leads people to commit violent or evil acts? How can these behaviors be reduced?
