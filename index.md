## hi!

I'm currently in my final year of undergrad, studying psychology and economics at Baylor University. 

My research interests revolve around:
- **AI Companionship**: Can AI companions sufficiently replace human relationships? Should it happen?
- **AI in Therapy**: Can AI replace therapists and make psychotherapy more accessible? What are its potential risks and benefits?
- **Psychopathy & Antisocial Behavior**: What leads people to commit violent or evil acts? How can these behaviors be reduced?
- **Methodological Issues in the Social Sciences**: Open science and methodological norms in psychology.

I write about lessons I've learned from the week on my [Substack](https://haleylam.substack.com). These include my research, stuff from the literature, and personal reflections.
